## Roadmap Evolution

- 2026-07-01 — Phase 3: added `family_mode`/`access_sensitivity` RPC-layer filter requirement (closes a gap between Phase 1.5's UI spec and Phase 3's success criteria). Source: `.planning/roadmap-app-store-audit-2026-07-01.md`.
- 2026-07-01 — Phase 4: added `access_sensitivity` field to `submit_location` scope. Source: same audit.
- 2026-07-01 — Phase 5: added "contribution verified" push notification success criterion. Source: same audit.
- 2026-07-01 — Phase 7: added `report_user` RPC and "report fixed" push notification. Closes the Apple 1.2 / Play UGC report/block-user gap identified as LAUNCH-BLOCKING in the audit. Source: same audit.
- 2026-07-01 — Phase 8: added save/favorite-location requirement and plan 08-04. Source: same audit.
- 2026-07-04 — Phase 3: added Nearby list-view tab (accessible alt to map, designed in Phase 1.5 but never scheduled into any phase) and a `family_mode` Settings toggle (the RPC-layer filter Phase 3 builds had no UI to ever activate it) — both folded into new plan 03-04. Source: `03-CONTEXT.md` discussion, two systematic cross-reference passes.

### Pending Todos

- [Non-comparative engagement and novelty ideas](../todos/pending/2026-07-06-non-comparative-engagement-and-novelty-ideas.md) — dopamine/retention mechanic ideas (discovery log, private streaks, gut-health trivia, quiet aggregate social proof, self-facing badges) compatible with the standing anti-comparative-gamification decision; not yet scoped to a phase.
